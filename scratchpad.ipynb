      "     - Net Profit: [974, 2,198, 3,274, 3,496, 3,337]\n",
      "   - **Reasoning**: The fourth and fifth-year Net Profit figures are significantly higher than CFO, suggesting that profits may be inflated through accounting measures rather than genuine cash generation. A consistent gap raises concern about earnings quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Negative CFO in 2 out of 5 years**\n",
      "   - **Facts**: CFO (-724 in Year 2, -541 in Year 5)\n",
      "   - **Reasoning**: Negative CFO indicates that the company is not generating operational cash flow consistently, which can signal problems with operational efficiency or revenue recognition issues, especially if accompanied by rising net profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decline in Promoter Holding**\n",
      "   - **Facts**: Promoter Holding: 52.90% \n",
      "   - **Reasoning**: A declining trend in promoter holding (not explicitly provided but can be inferred as a red flag if it were decreasing) often signals a lack of confidence from management in the company’s prospects. Since this is the latest figure and no historical data is provided, any past decline would further warrant caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **High Level of Borrowings Relative to Assets**\n",
      "   - **Facts**: Borrowings: 12,967, Total Assets: 40,647\n",
      "   - **Reasoning**: The debt-to-assets ratio is approximately 31.98%, which is moderately high. This could indicate that the company is heavily leveraged, raising concerns about its ability to service debt and financial stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Poor Net Profit Performance in the Face of Increasing Sales**\n",
      "   - **Facts**: Sales increased from 21,644 to 60,456 over five years, but Net Profit peaked in Year 4 and then declined to Year 5’s 3,337.\n",
      "   - **Reasoning**: Despite increasing sales, the inability to maintain or increase net profit in Year 5 can indicate potential inconsistencies in revenue recognition or excessive expenses not aligned with sales growth.\n",
